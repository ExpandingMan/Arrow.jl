    writepadded(io::IO, x)
    writepadded(io::IO, A::Primitive)
    writepadded(io::IO, A::Arrowvector, subbuffs::Function...)

Write the data `x` to `io` with 8-byte padding. This is commonly needed in Arrow implementations
since Arrow requires 8-byte boundary alignment.

If a `Primitive` is provided, the appropriate padded values will be written.

If an `ArrowVector` is provided, the ordering of the sub-buffers must be specified, and they will
be written in the order given.  For example `writepadded(io, A, bitmask, offsets, values)` will write
the bit mask, offsets and then values of `A`.
